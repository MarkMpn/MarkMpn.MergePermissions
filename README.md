# Merge Permissions tool for XrmToolBox

Merging records in Dataverse / Dynamics 365 requires more complex privileges than is immediately obvious, and setting up the
right security role can involve a lot of trial and error. This tool simplifies things by automatically creating or updating
security roles with all the privileges you need for merging.
